# Random-Projection-Ensemble-Classification

Cardiac arrhythmias, manifesting as irregular heart rhythms, present substantial diagnostic challenges exacerbated by the complexity and high dimensionality of electrocardiogram (ECG) data. Conventional classification methods frequently fall short in precision, struggling with the nuanced ECG patterns. This study harnesses the random-projection ensemble classification technique, originally innovated by Timothy I. Cannings and Richard J. Samworth, to enhance the accuracy of diagnosing cardiac arrhythmia. By utilizing data from the UCI Machine Learning Repository, our approach projects the high-dimensional ECG data into a lower-dimensional space. This method effectively reduces the curse of dimensionality and uncovers underlying structures that are conducive to more accurate classifications, offering a promising advancement in medical diagnostics.
